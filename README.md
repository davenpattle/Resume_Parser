# Resume_Parser
The project ports existing resumes from their unstructured pdf, doc or docx format to a sematic data model upon which semantic queries can be run. By porting all the resumes to semantic data model and storing them in a database or file system, semantic queries can be run upon them to retrieve the desired resumes and by result candidates.
